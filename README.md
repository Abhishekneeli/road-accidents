# road-accidents
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data from 50 major cities in India for the year 2020. Using tools like Python, SQL, and Excel, the project aims to uncover insights into accident causes, their subcategories, and the resulting outcomes such as injuries and fatalities. The dataset categorizes accidents based on factors like traffic control, road features, vehicle impact, and weather conditions. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques, the project identifies patterns in accident occurrences and severity. The insights derived from this analysis can help policymakers and urban planners develop strategies for improving road safety and reducing accident rates in densely populated areas.
